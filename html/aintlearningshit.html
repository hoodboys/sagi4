    <h1>the <b>king</b> is in the <i>field</i></h1>
    <h2> <b>wake up</b> <small>bro</small> </h2>
    <p>Rabbi <span style="color: rgb(180, 173, 230);" >Schneur Zalman of Liadi explains the paradox of Elul with the following metaphor: The king's usual place is in the capital city, in the royal palace. Anyone wishing to approach the king must go through the appropriate channels in the palace bureaucracy and gain the approval of a succession of secretaries and ministers. He must journey to the capital and pass through the many gates, corridors and antechambers that lead to the throne room. His presentation must be meticulously prepared, and he must adhere to an exacting code of dress, speech and mannerism upon entering</span> into the royal presence.</p>

    <p><sub>However, there are times when the king comes out</sub> to the fields outside the city. At such times, anyone can approach him; <mark>the king receives them all</mark>  with a smiling face and a radiant countenance. The peasant behind his plow has access to the king in a manner unavailable to the highest ranking minister in the royal court when the king is in the palace.</p>

    <p>Bread <div style="color: lightcoral;">is the</div> "staff of life" that "sustains the heart of man." There was a time when most everyone plowed, sowed and harvested the grain that sustained him and his family; but even today, when only a small percentage of us farm the land, we all labor for bread. Everyone works in the field â€” be it the wheatfield or cornfield, or the field of banking, steelmaking, medicine or advertising.</p>
